Begin by working with your team to look for processes that can be streamlined, paperwork that can be reduced, and other ways the team can be made efficient. From this list, choose one that looks easy to address but that can have immediate impact.
Next, follow a classic design process to describe your problem clearly and plan a solution. 

Making a plan
List your pain points: brainstorm about issues you could solve
Choose one problem: select one that looks easy but has impact
Write a problem statement: pinpoint your overall goal
Identify features: identify problems and solutions that support your main goal

Learning about data organization
Learn key data modeling terms and decide which tables your sample app will need.
Tables: the categories of things you want to track
Records: individual instances of the things tracked in a given table
Fields: specific attributes describing each individual thing
Relationships: connections you make between tables to describe what they have in common
Decide: which tables the physical therapy app will need

Map fields: let FileMaker Pro Advanced help you put data where it belongs (1:14)
Check your imported data: view your records to make sure they’re what you wanted (2:42)
Re-set the serial number: ensure unique values in each new record you create (2:57)
Manage relationships: explore the relationship graph (0:10)
Create a relationship: link two tables to each other (0:43)
